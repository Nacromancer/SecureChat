# SecureChat
SecureChat is aimed at creating a secure (encrypted) communication environment in any given network.

#Pre-requisites
SecureChat is built with the help of [SocketServer](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/socketserver.py), [Crypto](https://github.com/golang/crypto), [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html), [socket](https://github.com/python-git/python/blob/master/Lib/socket.py), [time](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html) and [sys](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html).

So, for seamless operation of the server and the client, the above mentioned packages should be fetched and installed.
